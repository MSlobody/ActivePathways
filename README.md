# ActivePathways
ActivePathways is an R package that is available on [github](https://github.com/reimandlab/ActivePathways) and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ActivePathways/index.html) and was published in Nature Communications (doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13983-9) [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13983-9]

 
I am currently the main contributor to this package (from June 2021). Since this time I have:
- Developed new functions for p-value merging, allowing for directional information between datasets to be incorporated (“ActivePathways_2.0.0” branch).
- Created a python version of the package that is compatible with the conda environment.
- Created unit tests and ensured each function behaves as expected before uploading the changes to github and CRAN.
- Added new parameters to provide users custom coloring options.
- Updated the filtering procedure of gene sets provided by a GMT file.
- Fixed reported bugs.
